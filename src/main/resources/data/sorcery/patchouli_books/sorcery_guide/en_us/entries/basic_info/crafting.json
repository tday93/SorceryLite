This is the process used to $(l:wands/wand_core_attunement)convert a wand core into a functioning wand$(/l). It is also used to enhance certain sorcerous items with a particular material. Arcane Attunement does not use Arcana, but can occasionally have other requirements, such as being performed in a particular location. Any such requirements will be noted in the entry for the item being crafted."

To do so requires both an $(l:items/arcane_assembler)Arcane Assembler$(/l), and a properly prepared location using an $(l:advanced_constructions/arcana_damp)Arcana Damp$(/l). These are necessary to handle the extremely delicate Arcana manipulation needed for this method of crafting. Arcane Assembly will always use a catalyst item held in the offhand, as well as a number of additional items which must be in the players inventory for the craft to succeed. These items will be consumed by the crafting process."
